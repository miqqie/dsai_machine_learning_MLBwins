# ‚öæ MLB Wins Prediction with Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project explores how team statistics can be transformed into predictive features to estimate **Major League Baseball (MLB) team wins**.  

Using historical data, the notebook applies feature engineering, lag statistics, and regression models to uncover the drivers of team performance.  

üí° This project came out **top in an internal Kaggle-style competition**, achieving the **lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** among all submissions.

## üîë Key Steps  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created per-game metrics (e.g. runs/game, ERA, OBP) and lag features from prior seasons to strengthen predictive signals.  
- **Model Training**: Applied **Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)**, which balances Ridge Regression‚Äôs regularisation with kernel methods to capture non-linear relationships (e.g. between runs, OBP, and pitching). This avoided the need for extra polynomial or interaction features.  
- **Optimisation**: Tuned hyperparameters with `GridSearchCV` to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and generalisation.  
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
- **Workflow**: Designed a clean pipeline from raw stats ‚Üí engineered features ‚Üí model training ‚Üí predictions.  

## üìä Insights  
- Per-game statistics (like runs scored or allowed) provide stronger predictive signals than raw totals.  
- **Kernel Ridge Regression outperformed XGBoost and other more complex models**, which in fact produced worse MAE.  

## üìù Key Takeaways 
1. **Start Simple**: Simpler models can sometimes deliver better results.  
2. **Feature Engineering Matters Most**: The single biggest factor in reducing MAE was careful feature engineering, followed by **choosing the right model**, and only then **hyperparameter tuning**.  
3. **Per-Game Normalisation Beats Raw Totals**: Normalised features (e.g. runs per game) improved predictive power.  
4. **Regularisation Prevents Overfitting**: L2 regularisation in KRR helped stabilise results.  
5. **Interpretability Counts**: A simpler, well-regularised model gave clearer insights and more reliable outcomes than a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù approach.
